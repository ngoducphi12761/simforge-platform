### Local Setup Instructions

#### 6.1 Back-end
1. Setup database connection in `application.properties`.
2. Start the application:
   - When the application starts, it creates database products, countries, and states. The setup is in `config/SetupInitialData.java`.

**Step-by-step instructions**:
- *(Include detailed setup instructions and necessary screenshots such as database configuration and running the application)*

#### 6.2 Front-end
1. Configure API URL in `app/service/constant.ts`.
2. Start the application:
   - In the command line, type `npm start` to run the script for HTTPS.

---

### Azure Setup Instructions

**Using Docker Compose to deploy back-end APIs and MySQL on Azure App Services**:

1. Create a `Dockerfile` for the back-end to build the image.
2. Create a Docker Compose file including MySQL and back-end API.
3. Create a JAR file (ensure to comment out database information in `application.properties` to avoid deployment issues):
   ```bash
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
4. Build docker image for back-end API
   ```bash
   docker build -t phiducngo/cfd-fea-api:1.0.4 .
5. Push back-end image to Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/)
   ```bash
   docker push phiducngo/cfd-fea-api:1.0.4
6. Create Web App
   Go to App Services, create Web App and select Publish as Container.
